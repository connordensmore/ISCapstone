        <h1>Reverse Mortgage</h1>
            <p>If you own your own home and are at least 62 years of age, a reverse mortgage provides an opportunity to convert some of your home equity into cash. In the most basic terms, a reverse mortgage allows you to take out a loan against the equity in your home where you do not have to repay the loan during your lifetime as long as you are living in the home and have not sold it.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/120204.asp">How Does Reverse Mortgage Work?</a>
            <p>With a reverse mortgage, a lender makes payments to the homeowner based on a percentage of the value in the home. When the homeowner dies or moves out of the property, one of three things can happen:</p>
                <li>The homeowner or heirs can sell the home to pay off the loan.</li>
                <li>The homeowner or heirs can refinance the existing loan to keep the home.</li>
                <li>The lender can be authorized to sell the home to settle the loan balance.</li>

                <p>When you have a regular mortgage, you pay the lender every month to buy your home over time. In a reverse mortgage, you get a loan in which the lender pays you. Reverse mortgages take part of the equity in your home and convert it into payments to you – a kind of advance payment on your home equity. The money you get usually is tax-free. Generally, you don’t have to pay back the money for as long as you live in your home. When you die, sell your home, or move out, you, your spouse, or your estate would repay the loan. Sometimes that means selling the home to get money to repay the loan.</p>

                <p>Like any mortgage or financial products there are upsides and downsides. The downside to a reverse mortgage loan is that you are using your home’s equity while you are alive. After you pass, your heirs will receive less of an inheritance. Another possible downside would be regrets by taking a reverse mortgage too early in your retirement years. As you grow older your needs may also change and eventually a downsize may be of interest. Make sure that you weigh all pros and cons and consult with your trusted advisor on whether a reverse mortgage is right for your circumstances.</p>
