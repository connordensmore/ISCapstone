        <span>A reverse mortgage loan is a loan where borrowed money(from the equity in the home) + interest + fees each month = rising loan balance. Basically owners are pulling money from the equity of the home where that amount is added back to the principle balance of the home plus interest. The homeowners or their heirs will eventually have to pay back the loan plus interest. Usually the heirs must sell the property to pay back the loan. </span>
